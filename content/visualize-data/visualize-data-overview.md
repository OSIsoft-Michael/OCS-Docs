# Visualization

Visualization provides graphic representation of data, allowing you to review and understand the data more quickly and throughly. OCS includes multiple visualization tools.

 - Use the `Trend` page to monitor assets, anticipate problems, and proactively perform preventative maintenance. On the `Trend` page, you can convert stream data to a graphic view, which can reveal patterns in data, data anomalies, or trouble spots. 

 - Use the `Asset Explorer` page to create asset definitions to help organize and visualize information about a particular asset, such as a truck or a mixing tank.

 - Use the Power BI Connector to retrieve data views from OCS and make them available in Microsoft Power BI for advanced data visualization and analytics.
